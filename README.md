# CSE423-Project
Concept: A simple 2D tank battle game where two players control tanks and try to shoot each other. Mechanics: The tanks are made of lines and circles. Players can move tanks in any direction, aim, and shoot bullets (circles). Each player has health, and the game ends when one player's health is zero.
